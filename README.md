### Message from the creator

This tool is a small gift to welcome the new Solana traders who’ve joined our projects. Originally envisioned as part of a larger suite, I believe keeping it lean and focused for now is the right approach.

With the evolving dynamics under the new Trump administration and the rapid advancements in AI, I firmly believe that every project should have its own $token—not just for the culture, but to give everyone a stake in its success.

The world and its systems are transforming at an exponential pace. You might not fully grasp it yet, but staying ahead of the curve has never been more crucial.
